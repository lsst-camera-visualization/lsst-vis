- Update backend functions
    - average_pixel should be renamed to average_pixel from average
    - original_image_url in FireflyUtil
    - parameters passed in from frontend need to be fixed
        - average_pixel should become { region : {type, value} }
        - image_url should be renamed _imageURL
- How to check for overscan (probably not based on filename)
